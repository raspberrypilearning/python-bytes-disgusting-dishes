# Mentor Notes: Disgusting Dishes

## Project Overview

Learners create a funny, gross-out recipe using `print()` in Python.  
They practise using strings, line breaks, and emojis to output a full recipe card.

---

## What Learners Will Practise

- Using `print()` to display text
- Writing and formatting strings
- Choosing between single `' '` and double `" "` quotes
- Creating sequential, readable program output

---

## Teaching Tips

- Let learners suggest ingredients or vote on the grossest ideas
- Remind them that each `print()` starts a new line
- Demonstrate how an apostrophe in a word like "Don't" requires double quotes

---

## Extension Ideas

- Add a title for the dish (e.g. "Rotten Ratatouille")
- Include random selection (if theyâ€™ve learned `random.choice`)
- Turn the recipe into a short performance or video
