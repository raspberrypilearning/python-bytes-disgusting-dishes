# Mentor Notes: Picnic Panic ðŸ§ºðŸ¥ª

## Project Overview

**Picnic Panic** is the first project in a food-themed Python sequence. It introduces learners to Pythonâ€™s `print()` function, focusing on building a short, silly story line by line using strings, emojis, and character speech.

This project avoids using variables or f-strings (those are introduced in the next lesson: *Spicy Strings*), and ensures syntax stays simple while allowing for creativity and humour.

## What Learners Will Practise

- âœ… Using `print()` to output text
- âœ… Writing complete sentences as strings
- âœ… Adding emoji for fun and expression
- âœ… Including double-quoted speech inside a string
- âœ… Using apostrophes **outside** of speech (to avoid escape characters)
- âœ… Building a story line-by-line with humour

## Key Concepts Introduced

| Concept            | Notes                                                              |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `print()`          | Used throughout to display each line of the story                   |
| Strings            | Story elements written as complete strings                          |
| Double quotes      | Used inside `print()` to show someone speaking                      |
| Apostrophes        | Introduced only **outside** speech to avoid escapes                 |
| Syntax accuracy    | Matching quote marks, brackets, and clear output formatting         |
| Story structure    | Introduction â†’ event â†’ reaction â†’ twist                             |

## Teaching Tips

- Emphasise that only `print()` is being used here â€” no variables or input
- Use the emojis and silly story elements to keep learners engaged
- If they get errors, help them double-check for:
  - Matching quotes
  - Missing brackets
  - Commas or apostrophes that accidentally end the string early

## Suggested Follow-up

- Extend the story by letting learners add their own lines
- Ask learners to try different characters or endings
- Move on to **Lesson 2: Spicy Strings** to introduce f-strings and variables in a similarly silly way
