<h2 class="c-project-heading--explainer">Set the scene</h2>

You've just been hired as the printer for a very strange restaurant.  
Your job? To print out disgusting recipe cards for their latest menu!

In Python, text is called a <strong>string</strong>. You can make Python show a string on screen using <code>print()</code>.  
Each time you use <code>print()</code>, Python starts a new line in the output.

Start by printing a welcome message for your disgusting dish.

<div class="c-project-code">
--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 1
line_highlights: 1-2
---
print('🤢 Welcome to the DISGUSTING DISHES cookbook! 🤮')
print()
--- /code ---
</div>

<div class="c-project-output">
<pre>🤢 Welcome to the DISGUSTING DISHES cookbook! 🤮</pre>
</div>

<div class="c-project-callout c-project-callout--tip">
