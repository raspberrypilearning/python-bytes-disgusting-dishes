In Python, `print()`{:.language-python} outputs strings (words or numbers) to the screen.

Type the code to `print()`{:.language-python} Hello to the screen:

<div class="c-project-code">
--- code ---
---
language: python
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 10
line_highlights: 11
---
# Put code to run under here.
print(f'Hello')
--- /code ---

</div>

**Test:** Click the **Run** button. 
This is what you should see when you run your code.

<div class="c-project-output">
```
Hello
```
</div>

<div class="c-project-callout c-project-callout--tip">

### Tip

When you type an opening bracket `(`{:.language-python} the code editor will automatically add a closing bracket `)`{:.language-python} 
This also happens when you type an opening apostrophe `'`{:.language-python}.

<div class="c-project-callout c-project-callout--debug">

### Debugging

If you get an error then check your code really carefully. Check there are single quotes around `Hello`{:.language-python} so Python knows it is meant to be text.
