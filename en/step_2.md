Make the broccoli say something surprising!

<h2 class="c-project-heading--explainer">Talking vegetables?!</h2>

Let’s make the broccoli say something out loud!  
When you want to show someone speaking in your story, use double quotes `" "`{:.language-python} inside the single quotes `' '`{:.language-python}.  
This helps the reader where the speech begins and ends.

You can also add an emoji to your speech to make it funnier!

print('A giant broccoli walked into the field. 🥦')
print('It looked around and said, "Is it snack time yet? 😋"')

<div class="c-project-output">
A giant broccoli walked into the field. 🥦 <br />
It looked around and said, "Is it snack time yet? 😋"

### Tip

Try adding your own emoji to show how the broccoli is feeling:  <br />
😋 🤔 😱 😄 🗯️

### Debugging

If you get an error, check that:
- Your whole sentence is inside single quotes like `'This is text'`{:.language-python}
- The words someone is saying are inside double quotes `"like this"`{:.language-python}
- You’ve closed both sets of quotes properly and haven’t missed a `'` or `"` at the end
